# 0x1A. Application Server

This project focuses on integrating an application server into your existing web infrastructure, which currently serves web pages via Nginx. The goal is to configure the application server to handle dynamic content, such as the Airbnb clone project, and link it with Nginx for seamless content delivery. You'll set up a development environment on your server, deploy your Flask application, and ensure it runs smoothly using Gunicorn as the WSGI server. This project is crucial for understanding the interaction between web servers and application servers, enhancing your ability to debug and optimize web stacks effectively.
